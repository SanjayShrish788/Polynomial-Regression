# Polynomial-Regression
This project demonstrates Polynomial Regression for modeling non-linear relationships.

Overview

Extends Linear Regression by adding polynomial terms.

Dataset: Position_Salaries.csv (Job Level vs. Salary).

Shows the difference between linear and polynomial fit.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib

scikit-learn

📊 Steps Implemented

Import dataset.

Fit Linear Regression.

Transform features into polynomial terms.

Fit Polynomial Regression.

Visualize both models.

🚀 Results

Polynomial regression provides a much better fit for non-linear salary trends compared to linear regression.
